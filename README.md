# Own Analytics

## Purpose of this repo
I want a way to do website analytics that is simple and can be deployed internally; without relying on external companies.

## Running the server for development
1. `npm install`
2. in one terminal run `npm run watch-ts`
2. in a second terminal run `npm run start-dev`
